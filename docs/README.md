# Awesome Singer Official Portal [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

A curated list of awesome singer official portals.

> The reason why I want to sort out these doc since I think singers (or bands) are much more sensitive and know how to present art with their creative ways. As a front-end developer, you may be inspired by some of the concepts from these portals and even put it into practice. <b>There is one thing to inform</b> is that although it's called `Awesome Singer Official Portal` , few of the these portal's design taste & user experience are disappointing and there is still room for improvement. The simple description of singers are derived from wikipedia, and these lists are placed in alphabetical order.

> You can contribute your time & `Pull Request`, and encourage the author with `Star`.
